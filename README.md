Here's a summary of some of the key elements in your CSS:

1. **Body**: Setting the background color, width, and centering the content.

2. **#topContentWrap**: Styling the top content wrapper with a background image that repeats horizontally.

3. **#logoPanel**: Styling the logo panel, hiding text using text-indent, and using a background image.

4. **#aboutPanel**: Styling the about panel with background color, fonts, and links.

5. **#eventPanel**: Styling the event panel with background color, fonts, and links.

The CSS stylesheet referenced in the `<link>` element is likely responsible for styling the page's appearance.
